Great—I checked the “Container Lens” page for your project and gathered key details to build a more comprehensive and context-aware README for your GitHub repository. Here’s a polished **README.md** draft for your **IEEE-Envision-Project** (DockerDashboard):

# IEEE-Envision-Project (DockerDashboard)

**A web-based Docker container management system built with Django and the Python Docker SDK.** It offers users a secure dashboard to manage Docker containers through actions like start, stop, pause, resume, delete, and view logs—without needing CLI commands. ([IEEE NITK | Corpus][1])

---

## Overview

This project simplifies container operations via a web interface, addressing usability barriers of Docker’s CLI for beginners and reducing human error. Built using:

* **Django** (backend and templating)
* **Python Docker SDK** for container interactions
* **Django’s built-in authentication** for user login security ([IEEE NITK | Corpus][1])

---

## Features

* Secure user registration and login
* Dashboard view of all Docker containers, showing their IDs, names, and statuses
* UI action buttons for:

  * Start
  * Stop
  * Pause
  * Resume
  * Delete
* Search functionality by container name or ID
* View logs directly via the interface ([IEEE NITK | Corpus][1])

---

## System Architecture

1. User logs in via Django authentication
2. Backend queries the local Docker engine using the Docker SDK
3. Container metadata (IDs, names, statuses) is fetched and rendered via templates
4. Container actions (e.g., Start, Stop) are initiated from the UI, sent as HTTP requests to the backend, which calls the Docker SDK
5. Logs for each container can be viewed through the interface ([IEEE NITK | Corpus][1])

---

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prabhav-P2006/IEEE-Envision-Project.git
cd IEEE-Envision-Project
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

#### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### macOS/Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Your prompt should now show `(venv)`.

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install django docker
```

> *Tip:* Consider adding a `requirements.txt` file for easier dependency management in the future.

### 4. Run the Dev Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Usage

1. Register as a user or log in
2. Access the dashboard to view container statuses
3. Use action buttons to start, stop, pause, resume, or delete containers
4. Search containers via name or ID
5. Click on “View Logs” to inspect container logs

Let me know if you'd like to enhance it with additional elements—like a Docker setup (Dockerfile or `docker-compose.yml`), instructions on deploying with Gunicorn/Nginx, CI/CD guidance, or anything else!
